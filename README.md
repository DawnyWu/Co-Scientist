# AI co-scientist

An open source re-implementation of Google's **AI co-scientist** ([Gottweis et al., *Nature*, 2026](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-026-10644-y); [research blog, 2025](https://research.google/blog/accelerating-scientific-breakthroughs-with-an-ai-co-scientist/)) — a multi-agent system that takes a natural-language research goal and produces a tournament-ranked **research overview** of novel hypotheses.

**It runs on an LLM API key or on your Claude Code / Codex subscription.** The default routes everything through **OpenRouter**, so one key reaches 200+ models from every vendor and `[models]` can mix them per agent. You can also point `[llm] provider` at Anthropic, OpenAI, or Gemini directly, or at a local `claude -p` / `codex exec` CLI that authenticates with its own OAuth login and bills nothing per token. Under the CLI backends, structured output and citation provenance come back through a bundled MCP server. Either way the agents are identical — see [LLM backend](#llm-backend).

The agent roster, prompts, and control flow follow the paper. Source materials that were used to instruct the coding agent (mainly Claude Code) include:

- [`reference/8 Pseudocode of Co-Scientist agents`](reference/) — the supplementary pseudocode for Supervisor, Generation, Reflection, Ranking, Evolution, Proximity, Meta-review.
- [`reference/9 Prompts for the specialized agents in .md`](reference/) — the per-agent prompts from the paper's supplement, used verbatim (modulo Jinja interpolation) in [`config/prompts/`](config/prompts/).
- [`reference/AICoScientist-*.png`](reference/) — the architecture and component diagrams from the paper.

The agents:

- **Generation** — proposes hypotheses via literature review and simulated scientific debate.
- **Reflection** — reviews hypotheses for novelty, correctness, and testability; deep-verifies the underlying assumptions.
- **Ranking** — runs an Elo tournament with simulated debates between hypotheses.
- **Evolution** — combines, simplifies, makes more feasible, or out-of-box-reimagines top-ranked hypotheses.
- **Proximity** — embeds and clusters hypotheses to drive dedup and informative tournament pairings.
- **Meta-review** — synthesizes system-wide feedback and the final research overview.

A **Supervisor** parses the goal into a research plan and schedules agent tasks through a durable SQLite-backed queue with bounded concurrency.

This is an independent re-implementation in Python on top of pluggable LLM provider SDKs — not affiliated with Google or the paper's authors.

       new hypotheses re-enter the cycle


  Shared infrastructure
  ─────────────────────
  • LLMProvider  ─ metered API (anthropic / openai / any OpenAI-compatible)
                   or subscription CLI (claude_cli `claude -p`,
                   codex_cli `codex exec`) over OAuth, no key
  • ToolRegistry ─ web_fetch + pubmed_search / arxiv_search / europe_pmc_search;
                   web_search auto-registered iff TAVILY/BRAVE key set;
                   science-skills discovered via SKILL.md frontmatter
  • MCP server   ─ record_* schemas + research tools served to the CLI backends;
                   captures structured output and URL provenance
  • TokenBudget  ─ per-agent shares + global cap; reservation released on retry
  • EventBus     ─ in-memory fan-out to SSE for the live web UI
  • FaissStore   ─ IndexFlatIP per session, asyncio-locked, atomic save/load;
                   Voyage → OpenAI → hash fallback, rebuilt on a dim change
  • SQLite       ─ sessions / hypotheses / reviews / tournament_matches /
                   elo_journal / tasks / transcripts / system_feedback /
                   embeddings_meta / spans / events / bench_* (15 tables;
                   WAL, busy_timeout, idempotent migration runner)
```

## Install

```bash
# Recommended: Python 3.11–3.13 (FAISS wheel availability)
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

cp .env.example .env
# Add the API key for your chosen provider — or none at all if you plan to run
# on a subscription CLI. See "LLM backend" below.
```

Then pick one of the two backend families. Either an **API key** for the
provider you want:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...      # provider = "openrouter" (the default)
# or, to talk to one vendor directly:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...       # provider = "anthropic"
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...          # provider = "openai"
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...          # provider = "gemini"
```

> A stray `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment takes precedence over every
> OpenAI-compatible preset's own key, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` included — it gets
> sent to OpenRouter and rejected. Unset it, or set only the preset's key.

…or a **subscription CLI** installed and signed in, with no key at all:

```bash
claude          # Claude Code — complete the subscription login once, then quit
# or
codex login     # Codex — sign in with your ChatGPT account
```

## Initialize

```bash
co-scientist init
co-scientist list
```

`init` creates `data/` (artifacts, vectors, logs) and applies migrations to `data/co_scientist.db`. The output prints which backend it found and whether it is usable — a resolvable API key for an API provider, or the CLI's version and login state for a subscription backend.

```bash
co-scientist doctor    # backend readiness + MCP handshake, no model call
```

## Run a research session

```bash
co-scientist run "Identify hypotheses about microbiome-driven inflammation" \
  --n 3 --budget-usd 2.0 --wall-clock 600
```

This kicks off Generation → Reflection → Ranking → Evolution → Meta-review under the configured backend. The Supervisor schedules tasks, the Elo tournament refines a leaderboard, and the final research overview is written to `data/artifacts/<session_id>/final/overview.md`.

```bash
co-scientist serve            # FastAPI + htmx + SSE dashboard at localhost:7878
co-scientist report <id>      # print the final overview
co-scientist status <id>      # session metadata + counts
co-scientist pause <id> | resume <id> | abort <id>
co-scientist feedback <id> --kind directive --text "focus on metabolic pathways"
co-scientist doctor           # verify backend readiness and the MCP server
co-scientist estimate         # pre-flight equivalent-cost estimate
co-scientist eval [agent]     # run the rubric eval bundle (offline mode optional)
co-scientist tools list       # show every registered tool the agents can call
```

## LLM backend

Two families of backend serve the same agents, selected with `[llm] provider`:

| Family | `provider` values | Billing | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Metered API** | `openrouter` *(default)*, `anthropic`, `openai`, `gemini`/`google`, `groq`, `together`, `mistral`, `ollama`, `openai_compatible` | per token | an API key |
| **Subscription CLI** | `claude_cli`, `codex_cli` | included in a subscription you already pay for | the CLI installed and signed in |

They are fully interchangeable from the agents' point of view — the same six
agents, the same tools, the same structured-output contract. What differs is who
runs the tool-use loop, and whether tokens cost money. `[models]` is interpreted
by whichever family you pick, so switching usually means revisiting it.

### Metered API providers

Every agent talks to one provider per session. `openrouter` is the default because one key reaches every vendor's catalog, which is also the only way to give different agents different vendors in a single session. Any of the providers below works; pick whichever you have a key for.

Config is **deep-merged** over [`config/default.toml`](config/default.toml), whose `[models]` defaults are OpenRouter ids (`anthropic/claude-opus-4-7` and friends). So if you switch `provider` away from `openrouter`, override **every** key in `[models]` — any key you leave out keeps its OpenRouter default and will be sent to your new provider, which will reject it. `co-scientist doctor` and every `run` warn about ids that look like they belong to another provider, so you find out in preflight rather than at the first model call. Fill in model ids your chosen provider exposes (see the provider table below for examples per vendor):

```toml
[llm]
# Pick one. See the provider table below.
provider = "openai"   # openrouter | anthropic | openai | gemini | google | groq | together | mistral | ollama | openai_compatible

[models]
# Override ALL of these with model ids from your chosen provider.
# (Two tiers are enough: a stronger model for reasoning-heavy agents and a
#  cheaper one for the rest — set them to whatever your provider offers.)
parse_goal          = "<cheap-model>"
generation          = "<strong-model>"
reflection          = "<strong-model>"
evolution           = "<strong-model>"
ranking_pairwise    = "<cheap-model>"
ranking_debate      = "<strong-model>"
ranking_priority    = "<strong-model>"
metareview_feedback = "<cheap-model>"
metareview_final    = "<strong-model>"
classifier          = "<cheap-model>"
judge               = "<cheap-model>"
```

Providers are listed alphabetically. `openrouter` is the default, but nothing else about the system prefers it; pick whichever you have a key for.

| provider              | Endpoint                                                | API-key env var         | Example models                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `anthropic`           | api.anthropic.com                                       | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`     | `claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`                    |
| `gemini` / `google`   | generativelanguage.googleapis.com (OpenAI-compat)       | `GEMINI_API_KEY`        | `gemini-3-pro`, `gemini-3-flash`, `gemini-2.5-pro`        |
| `groq`                | api.groq.com                                            | `GROQ_API_KEY`          | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, `mixtral-8x7b-32768`           |
| `mistral`             | api.mistral.ai                                          | `MISTRAL_API_KEY`       | `mistral-large-latest`, `codestral-latest`                |
| `ollama`              | localhost:11434 — local models                          | *(none)*                | `llama3.3:70b`, `qwen2.5:32b`                             |
| `openai`              | api.openai.com                                          | `OPENAI_API_KEY`        | `gpt-5`, `gpt-4o`, `o3-mini`                              |
| `openai_compatible`   | Anything else; set `[llm.openai] base_url` explicitly   | `OPENAI_API_KEY`        | depends                                                   |
| `openrouter` *(default)* | openrouter.ai — 200+ models from every major vendor  | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`    | `openai/gpt-5`, `google/gemini-2.5-pro`, `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`, `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct` |
| `together`            | api.together.xyz                                        | `TOGETHER_API_KEY`      | `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo`                 |

> Key precedence: for every OpenAI-compatible preset (`openrouter`, `gemini`, `groq`, `together`, `mistral`, `ollama`), `OPENAI_API_KEY` is used **first** if it's set, and the provider-specific var above is only the fallback. So if you have a stray `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment it will be sent to the preset's endpoint (and rejected) — unset it, or set only the provider's own key, when using a preset.

#### Gemini thinking and tool calls

Gemini 3 models attach an opaque thought signature to function calls. The
OpenAI-compatible adapter preserves provider-owned tool-call metadata, but
only the named `gemini` / `google` providers replay Gemini's documented
`extra_content` envelope with the corresponding function result. Other
response-only tool-call fields are retained for diagnostics and future
provider adapters, but are not sent to endpoints that may reject them. No
manual signature configuration is required.

Gemini's thinking level is also optional. With `thinking_level = "default"`
the request omits `reasoning_effort` and Gemini uses the selected model's
default. For this system's autonomous, multi-step literature and evaluation
work, `medium` is a sensible starting point:

```toml
[llm]
provider = "gemini"

[llm.gemini]
thinking_level = "medium"  # default | minimal | low | medium | high

[llm.gemini.thinking_by_mode]
"parse_goal" = "minimal"
"reflection.verification" = "high"
"metareview.final" = "high"
```

Per-mode entries override the global level and use the same `agent.mode` names
as model routing. These semantic levels are separate from the numeric
Anthropic `[thinking]` token budgets. Do not fabricate or edit thought
signatures; the adapter treats them as provider-owned continuation state.

Every other provider talks to exactly one vendor. For multi-vendor routing inside a single session, stay on the default `provider = "openrouter"` and let it dispatch upstream per model:

```toml
[llm]
provider = "openrouter"
[llm.openrouter]
referer = "https://your-app.example.com"   # optional, for catalog attribution
title   = "My Co-Scientist"

[models]
generation         = "openai/gpt-5"
reflection         = "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet"
ranking_pairwise   = "google/gemini-2.5-flash"
metareview_final   = "meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct"
```

Any per-agent model can point at any vendor — the example above just mixes four. Use whatever combination you prefer.

Cost is estimated via `co_scientist/llm/routing.py`'s `PRICE_TABLE`; unknown models match a family-hint (flash / mini / opus / sonnet / gemini / llama / mistral) so brand-new previews price sensibly. Tighten `[run] budget_usd` if running on a new model you haven't sanity-checked.

**Provider feature support.** Tool / function calling is **required** — the agent pipeline is built on it, so a provider (or `openai_compatible` endpoint) that can't do function calling won't work. The other three rows are optional vendor-specific accelerators: when a provider doesn't support one, it's transparently skipped, never an error.

| Feature                     | `anthropic` | everything else (OpenAI + all OpenAI-compatible providers) |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tool / function call *(required)* | ✅    | ✅ native OpenAI; on other endpoints it must be supported or the run fails |
| Extended reasoning          | ✅ via numeric `[thinking]` budgets | ✅ OpenAI reasoning models use `reasoning_effort`; Gemini uses optional `[llm.gemini]` semantic levels |
| Prompt-cache breakpoints    | ✅          | ❌ (stripped before sending)                               |
| Batch API (50%-off ranking) | ✅          | ❌ (Anthropic-only; other providers run all matches synchronously) |

> For direct OpenAI and generic OpenAI-compatible endpoints, the reasoning-model check is a name heuristic ([`openai_client.py`](co_scientist/llm/openai_client.py) `_is_reasoning_model`). Model ids that do not match it still work, but do not receive a numeric `[thinking]` budget translated to `reasoning_effort`. The named Gemini provider uses its explicit semantic configuration instead.

### Subscription CLI backends

These execute every agent call through a local agent CLI running on a
subscription you already pay for. No API key is involved:

| `[llm] provider` | Drives | Auth | `[models]` values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `claude_cli` | `claude -p` (Claude Code) | OAuth login — run `claude` once | full ids (`claude-opus-4-7`) or aliases (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`) |
| `codex_cli` | `codex exec` (Codex) | `codex login` (ChatGPT account) | Codex model ids your account is entitled to |

```toml
[llm]
provider = "claude_cli"

[llm.claude_cli]
binary = "claude"
timeout_seconds = 900
max_parallel = 3          # bounded by the subscription rate limit, not CPU
replace_system_prompt = true

[models]
# `--model` accepts full ids, and those are what `[thinking]` budgets and the
# price table key off — so the defaults work unchanged under this backend.
generation = "claude-opus-4-7"
ranking_pairwise = "claude-sonnet-4-6"
classifier = "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"
```

Any `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` present in your environment is
**stripped from the CLI subprocess** ([`cli_backend/base.py`](co_scientist/llm/cli_backend/base.py)
`BILLING_ENV_VARS`), so a call can never silently fall back to metered billing.
A test asserts this.

### How structured output survives without an API

The agents depend on forced tool use (`record_hypothesis`, `record_review`, …),
and headless CLIs have no `tool_choice` flag. The project ships its own MCP
server ([`co_scientist/mcp/`](co_scientist/mcp/)) that the backend launches per
call and wires in via `--mcp-config`:

- **`record_*` tools** — the schemas from [`agents/schemas.py`](co_scientist/agents/schemas.py)
  verbatim, validated at the tool boundary exactly as the API used to validate
  them, then written to a capture directory the backend reads back.
- **research tools** — the existing PubMed / arXiv / Europe PMC / web_fetch
  registry, with every result's URLs appended to a provenance log. That is what
  keeps the citation verifier's "you may only cite what you actually saw" rule
  enforceable.

`--tools ""` disables the CLI's built-in tools so every tool call flows through
that server and lands in your transcripts.

### Things worth knowing

- **The CLI runs its own agentic loop.** Under these backends `run_tool_loop`
  does not drive turns; it issues one call and reads the capture. If a call ends
  without a structured record, it retries once with the search tools removed and
  the record demanded, then raises. Under an API provider the same function
  drives the classic assistant↔tool_use↔tool_result cycle — the switch is the
  backend's `runs_own_loop` flag.
- **`--system-prompt` replaces Claude Code's default prompt.** Measured on this
  machine: a trivial call under the default prompt costs ~19k cache-creation +
  ~24k cache-read tokens of harness scaffolding; with ours it is ~1–2k. Set
  `replace_system_prompt = false` if you want the harness context back.
- **`--bare` is unusable here** — it forces `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` auth and never
  reads OAuth, which defeats the point.
- **Rate limits are hours, not minutes.** Subscription limits clear over a
  multi-hour window, so rate-limit backoff starts at 30s and grows to 10min
  ([`llm/retry.py`](co_scientist/llm/retry.py)) instead of the seconds an API
  429 deserves.
- **`budget_usd` is not a spend gate here.** Nothing is billed per token under
  a subscription. The CLI reports an equivalent API cost per call and
  `budget_usd` caps that gauge, which still catches a runaway session. The real
  limits are `wall_clock_seconds` and `max_ideas`. Under an API provider
  `budget_usd` is real money again.
- **Codex model entitlement is a real gate.** A ChatGPT account that is not
  entitled to the model you name fails the run with
  `"model is not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account"`. Check
  with `co-scientist doctor` before a long run.

### Embeddings — independent of the backend

No agent CLI exposes an embedding endpoint, and Proximity/dedup needs real
semantic vectors, so embeddings always call a hosted API regardless of which
backend runs the agents:

```toml
[embeddings]
provider = "voyage"                # voyage | openai | hash
model = "voyage-3-large"
dim = 1024
```

With neither `VOYAGE_API_KEY` nor `OPENAI_API_KEY` this degrades to a local hash
embedder that catches literal token overlap but not paraphrase — sessions still
run, dedup is just weaker. Falling back from Voyage to OpenAI uses
`text-embedding-3-large` shortened to the configured `dim`, so vector width
never changes underneath an existing index. Changing `dim` yourself does
invalidate the FAISS indices under `data/vectors/`; the store detects the
mismatch and rebuilds rather than corrupting them.

## Configuration

Layered: [`config/default.toml`](config/default.toml) → `~/.co-scientist/config.toml` → `./co-scientist.toml` → `--config <path>`. Secrets come from environment only (see [`.env.example`](.env.example)).

## Bench: compare models head-to-head

`co-scientist bench` runs the same goal under N different `(provider, model)` configurations and ranks them via a single shared Elo tournament. Each candidate independently generates hypotheses; then every candidate-pair plays `--matches` head-to-head debates, judged by ONE fixed judge model (picked separately so no candidate scores its own work).

> **For live numbers** — per-candidate Elo, the actual hypotheses each model proposed, gold-set hits, and what the data showed — see [`docs/BENCH_RESULTS.md`](docs/BENCH_RESULTS.md). It includes a headline-findings section at the top so you don't have to scroll through every bench.

### Presets

Presets come in the same two families as the backends. **API presets** route
every candidate through OpenRouter — the only way to get cross-vendor
comparison, since no agent CLI serves a third party's models — and need
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. **CLI presets** run on a subscription and bill nothing per
token, but can only field what those CLIs serve.

| `--preset`             | Family | What it does |
| ---                    | --- | --- |
| `paper`                | API | The paper's own baselines (Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking → 2.0 Flash, Gemini 2.0 Pro → 2.5 Pro, OpenAI o1, plus Claude Haiku) — see [`bench/presets.py`](co_scientist/bench/presets.py) for each substitution and why |
| `paper-aml`            | API | The paper's AML drug-repurposing goal + gold-set recall scoring (strict top-3: Nanvuranlat / KIRA6 / Leflunomide) across those baselines |
| `paper-aml-vs-raw`     | API | Same, but each model runs **both** through the full pipeline AND as a single raw call — isolates the multi-agent harness's value-add |
| `frontier-aml-vs-raw`  | API | Same pipeline-vs-raw split across current frontier models (Claude Opus, GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro/Flash) |
| `claude-aml`           | CLI | The AML goal and gold set, run across the three Claude Code tiers |
| `claude-aml-vs-raw`    | CLI | Pipeline-vs-raw split across those tiers |
| `cross-backend-aml`    | CLI | Claude Code vs Codex on the same goal. Needs both CLIs signed in **and** a ChatGPT account entitled to the Codex model |

> **Do not compare across families.** The prompts and gold sets are identical,
> but under a CLI backend the tool loop belongs to the CLI rather than to this
> repo, and the `$` column becomes a reported equivalent cost rather than real
> spend. Pick a judge in the same family as your candidates. The numbers in
> [`docs/BENCH_RESULTS.md`](docs/BENCH_RESULTS.md) came from the API presets.

```bash
# Free (subscription): score the Claude Code tiers on the paper's AML picks.
co-scientist bench --preset claude-aml --n 3 --matches 2

# Free: isolate how much the multi-agent harness actually adds.
co-scientist bench --preset claude-aml-vs-raw --n 3 --matches 2

# Free: Claude Code vs Codex, if you have both signed in.
co-scientist bench --preset cross-backend-aml --n 1

# Metered (needs OPENROUTER_API_KEY): reproduce the paper's baseline comparison.
co-scientist bench --preset paper-aml --n 3 --matches 2

# Metered: current frontier models, pipeline vs raw.
# (--budget-per-candidate defaults to 3.0; frontier models need it.)
co-scientist bench --preset frontier-aml-vs-raw --n 1
```

### Pipeline vs raw LM (one model, isolated)

The `--preset *-vs-raw` presets pit each model's **full co-scientist Generation pipeline** (literature tools + tool loop + dedup + `record_hypothesis`) against a **single raw LM call** with the same model + a forced `record_hypothesis` function call (no tools). Lets you measure how much of the system's output quality comes from the multi-agent harness vs the underlying model. → live numbers in [`docs/BENCH_RESULTS.md`](docs/BENCH_RESULTS.md#headline-findings).

### Gold-set scoring (AML drug repurposing)

The `*-aml*` presets score **recall** against a curated answer key from the Co-Scientist paper. Two gold sets ship; both stay registered so historical bench artifacts remain interpretable.

| label                                                   | size | what it is |
| ---                                                     | --- | --- |
| `aml-repurposing-paper-top3` *(default for every `*-aml*` preset)* | 3 | Top-3 of the original paper's list: candidates with no prior published AML repurposing, no prior preclinical evidence in AML, and no external inputs (no DepMap scores, no expert curation). → **Nanvuranlat (JPH-203 / KYT-0353), KIRA6, Leflunomide (Arava / HWA-486 / Teriflunomide / Aubagio)** |
| `aml-repurposing-paper-5`                               | 5 | Broader 5-drug list referenced in the paper's main text: **Binimetinib (MEK162), Pacritinib (SB1518 / Vonjo), Cerivastatin (Baycol), Pravastatin (Pravachol), Dimethyl fumarate (DMF / BG-12 / Tecfidera)** |

Swap with `--goldset`:

```bash
co-scientist bench --preset claude-aml --goldset aml-repurposing-paper-5   # broader list
co-scientist bench --preset claude-aml --goldset none                       # head-to-head only
```

The matcher is whole-token, case-insensitive, and looks at every searched field of every hypothesis (title / summary / full_text / `entities` / citation excerpts). Drug **class** mentions (e.g. "DHODH inhibitor") do **not** count — the candidate has to name the actual compound (or one of its registered aliases).

### Custom candidates

`label=provider:model[@mode]`. `mode` is `pipeline` (default) or `direct`. Pipeline goes through the full Generation agent stack; direct is a single forced-tool LM call with no literature tools.

```bash
co-scientist bench "Identify hypotheses about X" \
  -c opus=anthropic:claude-opus-5 \
  -c opus-raw=anthropic:claude-opus-5@direct \
  -c sol=openai:gpt-5.6-sol \
  -c luna=openai:gpt-5.6-luna \
  --judge anthropic:claude-sonnet-5
```

### Where results live

Every bench writes to SQLite + JSON on disk:

```
data/co_scientist.db                          ← SQLite, all metadata
  bench_runs                                  one row per bench
  bench_candidates                            one row per (bench × candidate × mode)
  bench_matches                               one row per head-to-head

data/artifacts/<session_id>/                  ← JSON on disk
  bench/<bench_id>.json                       run summary + per-entity gold_hit_detail
  hypotheses/<hyp_id>.json                    every hypothesis the bench produced
  transcripts/generation/<trn_id>.json        every LLM call
```

The auto-generated [`docs/BENCH_RESULTS.md`](docs/BENCH_RESULTS.md) (rebuild with `python scripts/build_bench_report.py`) walks every recorded bench and renders the per-candidate result table, every hypothesis attributed to the model that produced it, and a post-hoc rescore against every registered gold set.

### Mechanics

- **Generation runs in parallel** per candidate under a deep-copied Config (`cfg.llm.provider`, `cfg.models.*`, thinking budgets zeroed for non-Anthropic).
- **Round-robin pairings**: every pair plays `--matches` head-to-heads (one random hypothesis from each side per match).
- **Structured verdict** via a forced `record_verdict` function call — no fragile `better idea: <N>` text parsing across providers.
- Bench runs are **isolated from regular sessions** — they don't write to `tournament_matches` or affect any session's leaderboard.
